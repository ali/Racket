;; Project Euler - Problem #25
;; Solved by Ali Ukani on May 19, 2011
;; "What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?"

;; 3 digits -> 100; n > (10^(3-1) -1)

(define lim (- (expt 10 999) 1))
;; Returns true if n has over 1000 digits
(define (stop? n) (> n lim))

;; a is term c-2
;; b is term c-1
;; c is the current term
;; t is what term c (c = a + b) is in the Fibbonacci sequence
;; Ex: a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, t = 2
